# RenAIssance-Project
Task 2 for the RenAIssance Project for Google's Summer of Code

Why This Project?
As a Computer Science, Linguistics, and Spanish student, this project brings together multiple areas of interest. Transliteration of early printed works is an underserved research area, and modern OCR tools are not equipped to handle historical texts. This project seeks to address that gap by developing a specialized model for text recognition in historical documents.
